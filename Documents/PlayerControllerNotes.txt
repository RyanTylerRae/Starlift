Normal:
- Equidistant movement
- Footstep loop is the same for walking and sprinting, I can improve this
- Fast walk is twice the speed of slow walk
- X to use, Y for tools, A to jump, B for UI purposes
- Center reticle is actually opaque, surprising
- Haptic feedback on bumping into things with enough force, jump or walk
- Space controls seem normal, the big thing is the button to match velocity
